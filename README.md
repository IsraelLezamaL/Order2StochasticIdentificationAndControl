# Order2StochasticIdentificationAndControl

A given transfer function (of unknown parameters) is known to be of second order nature, as it models the behavior of a DC motor; once the function is stochastically identified, and as the output is translated into the angular velocity of a tire belonging to a space exploration vehicle, a control system will be implemented in order to allow greater stability, life expectancy and benefit on the exploration vehicle in the long term; implementing improvements in design and innovations that may contribute to scientific development and human knowledge.
