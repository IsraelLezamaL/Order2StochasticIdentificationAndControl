# Order2StochasticIdentificationAndControl
A certain transfer function (with unknown parameters) is available, known to be second-order when modeling the behavior of a DC motor. Once the function has been stochastically identified, and upon translating the output to the angular velocity of a wheel belonging to a space exploration vehicle, a control function will be designed for the system.
